# WebSocketProximityLab

I used MVVM Design Pattern -
In code WebSocketManagerClasses folder plays role of viewmodel and Models folder plays a role of model and viewControllers is our view. 

Flow - View request a data from viewModel, view model get a data from websocket and send to the view for showing in a UI,

Below is the screenShots of Air index data city wise 
- Green Color indicate Good and Satisfactory Standard
- Orange Color indicate Moderate and Poor
- Red Color indicate very poor and severe.

next scren is live graph city wise, when we click on city then it will open live graph screen.

Time Taken Feature Wise -
WebSocket Connection Classes -  2 hr
Showing data in TableView - 1 hr
Live Graph - 1hr
Unit test cases - 1.5hr
